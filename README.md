With a strong academic background and a passion for research, I am eager to pursue a Ph.D. in Economics, Finance, or a related field.

*I believe the sum is greater than its parts, and the difference originates from the connectedness.*


## 🤩 Research Interests
I am interested in **how firms' financial decision making affects the economy and vice versa**.

### Network models and analysis
(Introduction to be Updated.) 
Modeling interconnectedness, contagion effects, peer effects or any other interactions among economic agents via networks.
### Applications of machine learning

Machine learning for macroeconomics and finance. For both theoretical and empirical models.
