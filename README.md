## Hello world! Welcome to my Github repository! 👋

### Research Interests

I am broadly interested in the interaction between financial markets and the real economy. My current work focuses on how financial frictions shape firm dynamics—particularly entry and exit from financial markets—and the implications for investment and employment. 

I am also interested in the role of financial intermediaries and institutional investors in corporate financing, with a focus on how their demand for financial assets influences firms’ access to capital. Drawing on recent developments in demand-based and intermediary asset pricing, I aim to study how the behavior of investors affect asset prices and, in turn, real economic outcomes. I am also exploring the use of machine learning techniques to uncover latent firm characteristics and improve empirical strategy in this context.
