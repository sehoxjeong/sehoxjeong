## Hello world! Welcome to my Github repository! 👋

### Research Interests

My research focuses on quantitatively analyzing the interaction between financial markets and the real economy. In my current work, I study how financial frictions faced by firms and financial intermediaries shape the dynamics of asset prices and corporate financing decisions.

Within this broader agenda, my work emphasizes the role of financial intermediaries and institutional investors in shaping corporate financing, focusing on how their demand for financial assets influences firms’ access to capital. Drawing on recent developments in demand-based and intermediary asset pricing, I study how investors’ portfolio decisions transmit to asset prices and, in turn, to real economic outcomes. I am also exploring the use of machine learning methods to uncover latent firm characteristics and to improve the empirical identification of these channels.
