## Hello World! üëã
I'm **Seho Jeong** and I study **financial economics** and **macroeconomics**. With a strong academic background and a passion for research, I am eager to pursue a Ph.D. in Economics, Finance, or a related field. *I believe the sum is greater than its parts, and the difference originates from the connectedness.*


## ü§© Research Interests

My primary academic interests lie in interactions of corporate finance, asset pricing and macroeconomics. Currently I am particularly interested in how firms' debt financing strategies influence firm-level investment and growth, as well as their implications for aggregate economic growth and business cycle. Additionally, I aim to analyze whether financial markets allocate capital efficiently across the economy, recognizing that capital misallocation can hinder firms' ability to grow. Furthermore, I am interested in leveraging machine learning techniques to uncover previously unobserved firm characteristics, providing novel insights into the dynamics of firm.
