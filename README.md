## Hello world! Welcome to my Github repository! 👋

### Research Interests

I am broadly interested in the interaction between financial markets and the real economy. My current work focuses on how financing frictions shape individual firm's capital structure. I also explore its implications on investment and employment, both on firm- and aggregate- level. 

I am also interested in the role of financial intermediaries and institutional investors in corporate financing, with a focus on how their demand for financial assets influences firms’ access to capital. Drawing on recent developments in demand-based and intermediary asset pricing, I aim to study how the behavior of investors affect asset prices and, in turn, real economic outcomes. I am also exploring the use of machine learning techniques to uncover latent firm characteristics and improve empirical strategy in this context.
